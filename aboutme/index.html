        <h2>Lito (that's how I was called when I was a child)</h2>
        <p>My name is Camilo Ferreira, I am 33 years old and married since 2019. I studied various software developing courses in last years but not being able to succeed that much as I would like to.</p>
        <p>After few years trying to get into IT industry, in 2021 I was able to switch to 3 IT jobs. First one trying out to be a Data Engineer trainee but I did not feel comfortable at that company, then working few months at TCS in Software Quality Assurance (besides being taught Automation Testing). Then switching over to Oktana Corporation as Software Quality Engineer in projects based in Salesforce stack, doing various testing types (brief API testing, manual testing, accessibility testing, automation testing).</p>
        <p>Last year I was able to obtain my Pathway Certificate along other IT related certificates: Scrum Master, Scrum Team Member, Automation Software Tester, Salesforce Certified Associate, among others.</p>
        <p>I hope I will be able to reinforce and improve my IT knowledge with this course.</p>
