                  <p>First of all, it is important to highlight the official figures provided by the Uruguayan government regarding stray dogs, amounting to 1750,000. This has an effect on various scales: from traffic accidents due to a stray or lost pet, pet fights in the exteriors, attacks on people by stray dogs, among others. Uruguay is currently promoting a new free chip ID system and castration program in search of improving traceability and responsible caring. This fervently demonstrates how important it is to take the necessary precautions to reduce your pet from getting lost by ensuring their safety and others as well. Perhaps the cipher does not seem so large at your daily life, either because by chance there are no stray animals in your area or you have not seen so many, still keep in mind that 245 animals are lost per week in Uruguay.</p>

                    <p>Remember and make your loved ones aware that a pet is a lifetime commitment. They need us just as much as when they are cubs and cute, as when they are old and clumsy. Prioritize the adoption before the purchase, the pet will be another family member, not an object.</p>
                    <p>When you get a dog or a cat, you have to be prepared to be its caregiver for the duration of its life which can be from eight to 15 years. And this means providing proper food, exercise, medical treatment and plenty of love.</p>
